    2. Check connections (AC adapter), damage, debries.
    3. Make sure the correct power adapter is being used. Are they using the correct adapter for the country they are in 120v vs 240v?
    4. Check that the battery has not been removed and is fully inserted. Does the battery provide voltage at all? Old batteries can cause system to overheat / freeze. Check for swollen battery which can be caused by age.
