## Introduction

```SMB (Server Message Block)``` is often found on Windows machines providing vertical/lateral movement. Network file shares may contain sensitive data, and versions of ```SMB``` may be vulnerable. ```SMB``` allows users and admins to share folders and make them accessible remotely. These shares often have sensitive information (such as passwords). Use ```smbclient``` to enumerate and interact with ```SMB```.










## Helpful Commands

* ```smbclient -N -L \\\<target_IP>``` - retrieve a list of available shares on the remote host (```-L```) and suppress the password prompt (```-N```).
* ```smbclient \\\\<target_IP>\\<sharename>``` - attempt to connect as a specific user after getting names fo the available shares. 
* ```smbclient -U <username> \\\\<target_IP>\\<sharename>``` - attempt to login with given username (will result in password prompt). 


## Enumeration

* ```smb-os-discovery``` - script that attempts to determine OS, computer name, domain, workgroup, etc. - see https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-os-discovery.html.

    ```nmap --script smb-os-discovery.nse -p445 <target_IP>```
