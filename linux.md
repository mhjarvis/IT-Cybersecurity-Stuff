# Linux

## Common Directories

`/etc` - stores system files.

`/var` - variable data; stores data that is frequently accessed or written by services or applications running on the system (e.g. log files, databases).

`/root` - home for the 'root' system user;

`/tmp` - temporary; stores data that is only needed to be accessed once or twice. Is cleared out on restart. Any user can write to this folder by default once they have access to a machine. Can be a good place to store enumeration scripts.
