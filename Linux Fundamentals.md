# <h1 style="text-align:center">Linux Fundamentals</h1>

Linux follows five core principles:

1. Everything is a file - all configuration files for various services that make Linux run are stored in text files. 
2. Small, single-purpose programs - numerous tools that work well together.
3. Ability to chain programs together to perform complex tasks - integration of different tools allow us to carry out complex tasks.
4. Avoid captive user interfaces - Linux is designed to work with the shell which provides increased control of the OS.
5. Configuration data stored in a text file - e.g. ```/etc/passwd``` stores all users on the system.
