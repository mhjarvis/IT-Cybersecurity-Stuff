## Introduction
SMTP is utilized for sending emails, usually paired with POP/IMAP, allowing a user to send and receive email. SMTP serves three functions:

* It verifies who is sending emails through the SMTP server.
* It sends the outgoing mail.
* If the outgoing mail can't be delivered, it sends the message back to sender.
