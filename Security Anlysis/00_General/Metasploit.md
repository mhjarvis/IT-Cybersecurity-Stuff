# <h1 style="text-align:center">Metasploit</h1>

## Introduction
The Metasploit Framework (MSF) is a prebuilt database of exploits for a variety of purposes. There are scripts for running reconnaissance, testing the existence of vulnerabilities (without compromising the target), tools for connecting to shells and running commands, etc. 

## Useful Commands

* ```msfconsole``` - start Metasploit.
* ```search exploit <vulnerability>``` - within MSF, search for a found vulnerability.
* ```use <full exploit path/name>``` - use the exploit.
* ```show options``` - view options available to configure; any option with ```Required``` set to ```yes``` needs to be set for the exploit to work.
