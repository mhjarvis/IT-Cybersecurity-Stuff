## Introduction
NFS allows a system to share directories and files with others over a network. Users can access files on a remote system as if they were local files. This is achieved by mounting all, or a portion of the filesystem on a server. That information can then be accessed with appropriate credentials.

First, the client will request to mount a directory from a remote host on a local directory just the same way it can mount a physical device. The mount service will then act to connect to the relevant mount daemon using RPC.

The server checks if the user has permission to mount whatever directory has been requested. It will then return a file handle which uniquely identifies each file and directory that is on the server.

If someone wants to access a file using NFS, an RPC call is placed to NFSD (the NFS daemon) on the server. This call takes parameters such as:

 The file handle
 The name of the file to be accessed
 The user's, user ID
 The user's group ID
These are used in determining access rights to the specified file. This is what controls user permissions, I.E read and write of files.
