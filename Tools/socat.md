## Introduction
```Socat``` is similar to ```netcat``` with a few extra features (like forwarding ports and connecting to serial devices). ```Socat``` can also be used to upgrade a shell to a fully interactive TTY. A standalone binary of ```Socat``` can be transferred to a system to get a more stable reverse shell.
