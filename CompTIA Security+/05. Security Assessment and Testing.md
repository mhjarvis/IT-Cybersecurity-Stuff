# Vulnerability Management

Cybersecurity professionals are responsible for building, operating, and maintaining security controls to protect against threats. Performing regular assessments and testing is an important component of this, as is making sure the controls in place are effective.

Vulnerabilities in your systems are inevitable, and new vulnerabilities will arise on a regular basis. `Vulnerability management` programs play a crucial role in identifying, prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities in our environments. They use `vulnerability scanning` to detect new vulnerabilities and then implement a remediation workflow to address the highest-priority vulnerabilities.

## Identifying Scan Targets

An organization has to determine which systems will be covered by a vulnerability scan. Which get scanned can depend on a variety of questions, like:

- What is the data classification of the info stored?
- Is this system exposed to the internet?
- What services are offered by this system?
- Is the system a production, test, or development system?

Automated techniques may be used, such as scanning tools that search for network or connected devices (known or unknown). This builds a `asset inventory`. Asset inventory and `asset criticality` can help decide which systems should be included and their priorities.

## Determining Scan Frequency

Vulnerability scanninig tools allow for automated scheduling of scans (Nessus). These scans should be configured to provide automated alerting when vulnerabilities are found. How often a organization conducts scans can depend on:

- The organization's `risk appetite`, its willingness to tolerate risk within the environment.
- `Regulatory requirements` may dictate a minimum frequency.
- `Technical constraints` can limit frequency.
- `Business constraints` may limit frequency due to resource-intensive scans may interfere with high business activity.
- `Licensing limitiations` may curtail bandwidth consumed by the scanner or the number of scans that may be conducted simultaneously.

Begin small, and slowly expand the scope and frequency.

## Configuring Vulnerability Scans

Admins can customize the types of checks performed by the scanner such as providing credentials to access target servers, installling scannnig agents on target servers, and conduct scan from a variety of network perspectives.

### Scan Sensitivity Levels

This determines the types of checks that will be performed. Should be in line to meet objectives and to minimize disruption of the system. Usually everything starts with a template. Plug-ins each perform a check for a specific vulnerability, and can be configured. Some can be disbled to fasten the scan and to prevent false positives.

`Intrusive plug-ins` are those that can actually disrupt or damage a system. One way to work with this is to test a copy of the system in a test environment.

### Supplementing Network Scans

Firewalls, IPS, and other protocols may interfere with scan results when conducting a test over a network. Remote scans can be supplemented. A scanner can be provided with credentials that allow it to retrieve configuration information and then analyze it to determine issues. This is `credentialed scanning` or `server-bsed scanning`. This is supplemented with `agent-based scanning`, where admins install small software agents on each target server. These agents conduct scans of teh configuration, providing an inside-out vulnerability scan, then report information back to the vulnerability management platform for analysis and reporting.

### Scan Perspective

`Scan perspective` refers to conducting a scan from different locations on a netowrk to provide a different view into vulnerabilities. External scans are run from the Internet showing the view of a attacker outside a location. Internal scanns might run from a scanner on the corporate network, showing the view of a malicious insider. Agents located on the server show the most accurate view - the real state of the server and its vulnerabilities.

Firewalls, Network segmentation, IDS, and IPS all may affect scans.

## Scanner Maintenance

Vulnerability scanners should be maintained to ensure the scanning software and `vulnerability feeds` remain up to date.

### Scanner Software

Even vulnerability scanners can have security issues. Regular patching is important.

### Vulnerability Plug-in Feeds

Scanners should be configured to retrieve new plug-ins regularly (preferabiliy daily). The `Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)` is an effort to create a standardized approach for communicating security-related information. The standard includes:

- `Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE)` - Provides a standard nomenclature for discussing system configuration issues
- `Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)` - Provides a standard nomenclature for describing product names and versions
- `Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)` - Provides a standard nomenclature for describing security-related software flaws
- `Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)` - Provides a standardized approach for measuring and describing the severity of security-related software flaws
- `Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF)` - A language for specifying checklists and reporting checklist results
- `Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL)` - A language for specifying low-level testing procedures used by checklists

## Vulnerability Scanning Tools

In a cyversecurity toolkit, you should have a network vulnerability scanner, a application scanner, and a web application scanner available for use.

### Infrastructure Vulnerability Scanning

Network scanners reach out to any device connected to the network and attempt to determine the type of device and its configuration, then launch targeted tests for vulnerabilities. Many orgs will deploy two different vulnerability scanners as a defense-in-depth control. Examples include:

- Nessus.
- Qualys vulnerability scanner (SaaS).
- Rapid7's Nexpose.
- OpenVAS, opensource.

### Application Testing

Application testing tools are commonly used as part of the software development process. This should be part of the dev process. Application testing occurs using three techniques:

1. `Static testing` - analyzing code without executing it. Points directly to vulnerabilities and often provides remediation suggestions.
2. `Dynamic testing`- executes code as part of the test, running all interfaces that the code exposes to the user with a variety of inputs, searching for vulnerabilities.
3. `Interactive testing` - combines static and dynamic testing, analyzing the source code while testers interact with the application through exposed interfaces.

### Web Application Scanning

Web application vulnerability scanners are specialized tools checking the security of web applications. These test for web-specific vulnerabilities (e.g. SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF)). They send known malicious input sequences and fuzzing.

Ex. Nikto - open source, or Arachni - open source.
