## Introduction
To help manage large Windows-based netwroks (e.g. configure policies, provide on-site support), we can use a Windows domain. A Windows domain is a group of users and computers under the administration of a business / org. The main idea behind such a domain is to centralize the administration of the common components of a Windows computer netwrok in a single repository called Active Directory (AD). The server running the Active Directory services is called the Domain Controller (DC). This provides:

* Centralized identity management
* Managing security policies

A common example of AD in use is on a college campus where you can log into the school org with a username/password, but you have restricted access to numerous functions (e.g control panel).
